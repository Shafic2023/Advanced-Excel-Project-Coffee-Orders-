##Coffee Shop Customer Orders Dashboard

## Problem Statement
Our objective is to create a fully interactive and informative dashboard in Excel that provides insights into customer orders for a coffee shop. The dashboard is designed for technical users to help them analyze sales, profits, customer behavior, and delivery performance effectively.

## About the Dataset
The dataset can be found in the files sections of the repository and it is a modified version of Mo Chen's dataset which can be found ![here](https://github.com/mochen862/excel-project-coffee-sales). includes customer order information with the following fields:
- `Order Date`: Date when the order was placed
- `Delivery Date`: Date when the order was delivered
- `Customer Name`: Name of the customer
- `Customer Address`: Address of the customer
- `Coffee Types`: Type of coffee ordered
- `Roast Types`: Type of roast ordered
- `Address` : Location of the customer
- `Sales`: Total sales amount
- `Profits`: Total profit amount
- `Loyalty Card`: Indicator if the customer has a loyalty card
- `Product ID`: Unique identifier for the product

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involved:

I modified the dataset and included Address
1. **Removing Duplicates**: Ensuring each order is unique.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Filling or removing missing data appropriately.
3. **Standardizing Formats**: Ensuring dates, addresses, and other fields have a consistent format.
4. **Correcting Data Types**: Ensuring all fields have the correct data types (e.g., dates, numbers).
5. **Creating Excel Tables**: Converting data ranges into tables for easier management and updates.

## Findings
From our analysis, we discovered several key insights:
- **Sales Trends**: Sales peak during certain times of the year, indicating seasonal demand.
- **Popular Products**: Certain coffee and roast types are significantly more popular than others.
- **Customer Loyalty**: Customers with loyalty cards tend to make more frequent purchases and contribute to higher sales.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Sales are higher in specific geographic areas, indicating target regions for marketing.
- **Delivery Performance**: Average delivery times have improved over the months, reflecting better operational efficiency.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are made:
1. **Targeted Promotions**: Focus marketing efforts on high-demand seasons and popular products.
2. **Loyalty Programs**: Enhance loyalty programs to further increase customer retention and sales.
3. **Operational Improvements**: Continue to improve delivery processes to maintain and further reduce average delivery times.
4. **Regional Strategies**: Develop region-specific strategies to capitalize on high sales areas and improve performance in lower-performing regions.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. **Data Input**: Ensure the dataset is updated with the latest customer order information.
2. **Open the Excel File**: Open the Excel file containing the dashboard.
3. **Interact with the Dashboard**: Use slicers and filters to interact with the data and explore different aspects of the customer orders.
4. **Analyze Insights**: Review the charts and metrics to gain insights into sales, profits, customer behavior, and delivery performance.

## Conclusion
The Coffee Shop Customer Orders Dashboard provides valuable insights that can help drive strategic decisions and improve overall business performance. By leveraging the findings and recommendations, the coffee shop can enhance its operations, marketing efforts, and customer satisfaction.
